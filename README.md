# VirtualToolkitSC
A (prototype) collaborative toolkit that supports Swing (desktop), AWT (desktop), GWT (web). The (basic) collaboration is achieved through the Firebase Realtime Database.

Instructions:

Replace "virtualtoolkitsc-firebase-credentials.json" file with your own.

GWT 2.8.2+ must be used.

This software was implemented in Eclipse using GWT Eclipse Plugin (V3), which makes working with GWT a lot easier.
